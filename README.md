# Evalprof
EvalProfs aims to reinforce the quality of school evaluations through the mutualisation of lecturer resources. It creates a digital platform for collaboration among lecturers, enabling them to share materials, generate continuous assessments or exam-based contextual evaluations, and exchange knowledge based on course topics and educational levels.
